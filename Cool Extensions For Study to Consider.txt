Another interesting extension to the study would be to analyze the data with an extended WSLS model which assumes there is a change in the alpha and/or beta parameters once the switch-trial (tau) is reached. Such a model can account for subjects being in an exploration state (high alpha and high beta expected) or exploitation state (even higher alpha and low beta expected).

As a side note, the selection of the team with a higher chance of winning can also be used to determine if the subjects had an adequate number of trials to reach the correct conclusion or not. If they did, we would see most/all subjects get the correct answer, but if not, we would expect the proportion of correct answers to closely match random chance. In this study, most participants had an adequate number of trials for each condition to determine the better team.
