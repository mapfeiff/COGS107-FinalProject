## Requirements
> list the requirement in requirement.txt
>
> if you have the requirements, can run main.py directly instead of executing ./start-up.sh

## How to Run:
> create python virtual environment (or can run locally)
>
> then execute ./start-up.sh in the environment (pip unfreeze command already present)
>
> run the experiment (ensure that you have a subject ID given to you)
>
> then execute ./end-down.sh in the environment (all data ill then be saaved to github anonymously)
>
> Lastly, can choose to keep file or delete the repository locally (nothing needs to be done with the files after running ./end-down.sh)
